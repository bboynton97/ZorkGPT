## What is Zork and why does this matter?
_This description was generated by ChatGPT_

Zork is a classic text-based adventure game that was first released in the late 1970s and early 1980s by a company called Infocom. The player takes on the role of an adventurer who explores an underground empire, solving puzzles and completing tasks in order to progress through the game. The game is significant because it was one of the first commercially successful text-based adventure games and helped to establish the adventure game genre. It also popularized the use of interactive fiction and natural language processing, which are now common features in many modern video games. Additionally, Zork was one of the first games to be distributed via computer bulletin board systems and online services, which was a precursor to the online distribution of games we see today.
